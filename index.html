    <p>
      This sleep classification model is an attempt to make sleep-staging more accessible through wearables. The current gold-standard of sleep classification is a PSG (polysomnography). 
      PSGs are extremely intensive as they require a participant to spend the night in a sleep lab, connected to devices monitioring brain activity through EEG data, eye movements through 
      EOG, muscle activity through an EMG, heart rate through an ECG, and breathing and blood oxygen levels. This extreme procedure limits many from learning about their health through their 
      sleep. This model uses only data that can be collected through a standard wearable such as an Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch. It classifies a night of sleep through binary CNN classifiers
      by predicting for every second the probability that second is Wake, REM sleep, N1 sleep, N2 sleep, or N3 sleep. It then predicts sleep stage using those probabilities. In addition to the actual 
      outputted predicted sleep stage for each second, this model gives valuable insight into a night of sleep by revealing patterns within the probabilities. See the section below regarding how to 
      use the pipeline and run data from a night of sleep through it. This project is part of a Master's Thesis in the Fluid Interfaces group in the Media Lab at MIT. Please contact adulski@mit.edu
      with any questions regarding the model or results.
