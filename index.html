        <h2>What is this project?</h2>
        <p>This model uses machine learning to classify sleep stages based on data from any wearable that can provide HR data and Accelerometer data. 
            The goal of this site is to make sleep classification more accessible to the average person with a wearable, as opposed to in-depth analysis in a sleep lab.
