# Sleep Stage Classification
See the site: https://abbydulski.github.io/Sleep-Stage-Classification/ for an explination of the project and for instructions on how to run your wearable sleep data through the classification pipeline. Inputs needed for the pipeline are accelerometer data, temperature data, and HR data from a standard wearable device. This project is part of a Master's Thesis out of the Fluid Interfaces group in the MIT Media Lab. Please contact adulski@mit.edu with any questions.
